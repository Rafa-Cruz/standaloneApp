This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started
## Build your application using npm

- npm install

*Then, execute the following command

- npx react-native run-windows

*and finally this one

- npx react-native autolink-windows

(For more information, visit this link https://microsoft.github.io/react-native-windows/docs/getting-started)

## Run application

npm run start

Once you run this command, open a Visual Studio and then open the Solution file located on windows folder.

Once you do that, VS will build the binaries so as to run your Win app. After that, just run the configuration "Local Machine" (ensure Debug and x64 dropdowns are selected). It will take few minutes first time because it has to build several Windows files.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
